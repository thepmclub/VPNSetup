PMC VPN Setup to work with VPN Chance - Enigma2 Devices


This is a very basic script, it can be easily improved upon!

Install using: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thepmclub/VPNSetup/master/openvpnsetup.sh | bash

Setup VPN to work with NordVPN: pmcvpnsetup nord username password

If your username/password has illegal characters you will need to escape them with single quotes, i.e pmcvpnsetup nord username '!password'
